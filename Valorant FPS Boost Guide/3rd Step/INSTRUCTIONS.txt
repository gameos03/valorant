Open ISLC as adminstrator by right clicking on it then click "Run as admin" then check the
option "Custom timer resolution" and make wanted timer resolution to "0.50" then set
ISLC polling rate to "10000" then make "Free memory is lower than" to half the number 
you see beside total system memory so for me that was 8000mb which is 8gb ram so i set
"Free memory is lower than" to 4000mbs after thats done, click the start button
and then MINIMIZE the program DONT close it while playing games so it actually works.
If you have any problems  with following these steps just comment on the video
and I will reply.
